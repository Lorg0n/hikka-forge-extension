# Privacy Policy for Hikka Forge

**Effective Date:** February 10, 2026\
**Contact Email:** lorgon.kv+support@gmail.com

## 1. Introduction

Hikka Forge ("we", "us", or "our") provides a browser extension designed to enhance the user experience on hikka.io through interface modifications and personalized recommendations. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Google Chrome Web Store policies.

For the purposes of data protection laws, the developer of Hikka Forge is the Data Controller of your personal information.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect and process specific categories of data necessary to provide the extension's functionality.

**Authentication and Profile Data**\
Authentication is initiated explicitly by the user and is never performed automatically.

When you authorize Hikka Forge via OAuth, we collect a locally issued access token generated by our backend service, Hikka User ID, username, avatar URL, and user role. We create a corresponding user record (shadow profile) in our secure database to manage your settings and preferences across devices.

**User Content and Activity**\
To generate personalized anime recommendations via our Machine Learning algorithms, our backend server retrieves, synchronizes, and stores copies of your anime lists (including Plan to Watch, Completed, Dropped lists) and your specific ratings for titles.

**Technical Data and Settings**\
We store your extension configuration, such as enabled modules, theme colors, and font preferences, in your browser's local synchronization storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). We also collect anonymous error logs regarding failed API requests to assist in debugging and stability improvements, which are not linked to your personal identity.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

Under the GDPR, we process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:

*   **Performance of a Contract:** We process your User ID, authentication tokens, and anime/manga lists to deliver the core features of the extension, such as displaying your profile and generating personalized recommendations.
*   **Legitimate Interests:** We process aggregated ratings and list data to train and refine our recommendation algorithms, which improves the service quality for all users.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely to provide and improve the Hikka Forge service. Specifically, we use your data to authenticate your requests to the Hikka API, synchronize your interface settings, and process your watch history to suggest relevant content. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to third parties. We do not use your data for advertising, retargeting, or creditworthiness assessments.

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

Your authentication tokens and visual settings are stored locally on your device. Your user profile data and synchronized anime lists are stored on our secure backend servers (`hikka-forge.lorgon.dev`).

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Hikka Forge services to you. If you uninstall the extension or revoke access via your Hikka account settings, your local data is deleted immediately. Data stored on our servers is retained until you request deletion or until the account is deemed inactive for a prolonged period, after which it is anonymized or permanently deleted.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Our extension interacts with hikka.io to retrieve content and user data necessary for the extension's operation. We may also use secure third-party hosting providers to maintain our backend infrastructure and database. These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations.

## 7. Your Rights

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have specific rights regarding your personal data. You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you, to request that we correct any inaccuracies, and to request the erasure of your personal data ("right to be forgotten"). You also have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your data and the right to data portability.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at **lorgon.kv+support@gmail.com**. We will respond to your request within the timeframes required by law.

## 8. Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. All data transmission between the extension, our servers, and Hikka.io occurs over a secure HTTPS connection.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last updated.
